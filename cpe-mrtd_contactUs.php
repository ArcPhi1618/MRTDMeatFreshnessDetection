                         The eldest daughter among two siblings, Riclyn strives to 
                        become an engineer not only for herself but also to give

                    Her dedication and perseverance fuel her journey in 
                    Computer Engineering. She thought of the concept of Fresh 
                    Track began during a lighthearted conversation with her 
                    friend Von Lander while a teacher was lecturing. What 
                    started as a random “chika” turned into an inspiring 
                    idea, proof that even casual moments can spark innovations 
                    that matter.
