                        The Development of a Real-Time IoT-Enabled Spoilage Detection 
                        System also known as “Fresh Track” is a research-driven innovation 
                        that aims to ensure food safety and quality by monitoring the 
                        freshness of meat in real time. This system integrates deep 
                        learning with gas emission, environmental, and pH sensors to 
                        accurately detect spoilage and predict freshness.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Using wireless communication and a cloud-based database, the 
                        system collects sensor data and makes it accessible through a 
                        user-friendly graphical interface. The platform not only monitors 
                        freshness but also predicts spoilage times and provides 
                        recommendations for proper storage and handling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our solution combines IoT technology, advanced sensors, and 
                        Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on meat images to 
                        identify meat types, track environmental factors, and enhance 
                        spoilage detection accuracy. The system is housed in a durable 
                        casing and equipped with a troubleshooting mechanism to ensure 
                        reliability and efficiency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, it bridges technology and food safety, offering a 
                        modern way to monitor meat quality and improve consumer trust in 
                        fresh products.
